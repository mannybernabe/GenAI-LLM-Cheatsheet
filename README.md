## Understanding Generative AI and Large Language Models

This visual serves as a quick reference to the essential concepts in Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). It covers the hierarchy from AI to ML to DL, dives into the specifics of GenAI and LLMs, and discusses their applications and modalities.

Inspired by some of my favorite GenAI resources, which can be found [here](https://github.com/mannybernabe/genairesources).
